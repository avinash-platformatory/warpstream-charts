# CHANGELOG

## 0.8.0

- The default replica count has been increased from 1 to 3. You can pass `--set replicas=1` to restore the previous behavior.
- Pod Disruption Budget is now supported. Pass `--set pdb.create=true` to enable it.

## 0.11.0

- Config variable `agentPoolName` exposing `WARPSTREAM_AGENT_POOL_NAME` is removed.
- Config variable `region` exposing `WARPSTREAM_REGION` is added.

## 0.12.0

- Compute resources are specified. Each Agent replica requests 2 vCPUs and 8 GiB of memory.
- `GOMAXPROCS`, used by the Agents to determine how many cores they have, is set to the requested number of vCPUs.
- The recommendation is to have at least 4 GiB of dedicated RAM per vCPU.
